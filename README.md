# Switcher Library

A TypeScript library that provides a flexible and easy-to-use switch-case mechanism, allowing for more readable and maintainable code.

## Features

- **Flexible case conditions** with `case()`, `caseOr()`, and `caseAnd()`.
- Supports **default values** with `default()`.
- Allows **breaks** to stop execution early with `break()`.
- Works with complex conditionals using `caseOr()` (OR logic) and `caseAnd()` (AND logic).

## Installation

```bash
npm install switcher-library
```
